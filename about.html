      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>The Society of Ontario Freethinkers (SOFREE) was founded in 1992 as the Kitchener Waterloo Cambridge Guelph Humanist Association. Members chose the current name in 2002. SOFREE's purpose from the beginning has been to provide a strong community for non-religious residents of Waterloo Region and beyond.<br /><br /><br />

      SOFREE is a registered charity and is operated by its members, most of whom live in Southwestern Ontario, through an annually elected board of directors and executives.<br /><br />

      Membership is open to adults. Children (under 18 years old) are welcome at SOFREE events with their parent or guardian. Students are offered membership fee discounts.<br /><br />

      SOFREE has no formal affiliation with other organizations, but is a partner in the annual World Religions Conference,in the Grand River Secular Alliance (GRSA), is registered with Atheists Unite Ontario Network, and is a regular participant in community events like the Multicultural Festival and the Non-Violence Festival.</p>
